            <h1 class="" ><b>Evaluation of schools in Egypt</b></h1>
            <p>Schools in Egypt can be evaluated through a set of criteria, including:<br> 
                <li>Level of academic achievement: The level of academic achievement of students is measured through the results of national and international tests.</li>
                <li>Teachers’ competence: Teachers’ competence is measured through indicators, such as academic qualifications and professional experience.</li>
                <li>Quality of the curriculum: The quality of the curriculum is measured by its suitability to the needs of students and the requirements of the labor market.</li>
                <li>Learning environment: The learning environment is measured by the extent to which it provides appropriate educational facilities and means for students.</li>
                <li>Community participation: Community participation is measured by the extent to which the community contributes to supporting the educational process.</li>
                <li>Low level of academic achievement: The results of national and international tests indicate that the level of academic achievement of Egyptian students is low compared to other countries.</li>
                <li>Weak efficiency of teachers: The education sector in Egypt suffers from weak efficiency of teachers, as teachers do not receive adequate training, and there is no effective system for evaluating teachers’ performance.</li>
                <li>Poor quality of the curricula: The curricula in Egypt suffer from poor quality, as they do not reflect the requirements of the labor market, and do not take into account individual differences among students.</li>
                <li>Inadequate financial resources: Schools in Egypt suffer from insufficient financial resources, as there are insufficient budgets to provide an appropriate educational environment for students.</li>
                <li>Low employment opportunities: Students are unable to obtain good job opportunities due to low level of academic achievement.</li>
                <li>High unemployment rates: Poor quality of education leads to high unemployment rates among youth.</li>
                <li>Poor social development: Students are unable to contribute to social development due to weak critical and analytical thinking skills.</li>
                <li>gyptian government is trying to address these problems through a set of measures, including:</li>
                <li>Expanding the education base: The government is working to expand the education base by establishing new schools and providing educational opportunities for students from deprived areas.</li>
                <li>Improving the quality of education: The government works to improve the quality of education by developing curricula, training teachers, and providing the necessary material resources to schools.</li>
                <li>Combating school dropout: The government works to combat school dropout by providing material and moral support to students and their families.</li>
